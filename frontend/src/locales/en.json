  "about.as.gian": "When I am not working, I am likely watching movies, playing video games or doing an extreme sport like paragliding or mountain biking. Also I love spend time with my children and to share fun times. We usually go to the beach, play or ride a bike. This last activity I do only with my two eldest sons Joan 8-year and Danny 4-year. My youngest son Gian is barely one and a half years old. He can't ride a bike now... But he is eager to grow and join us in the fun. He already walks alone!!",
